## Introduction

Data analysis is a crucial skill in today's data-driven world. It involves gathering, cleaning, processing, analyzing, and visualizing data to derive meaningful insights and make informed decisions. This guild aims to introduce beginners to the fundamentals of data analysis using Jupyter Notebook, a popular open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.

## Getting Started

To get started with this guild, make sure you have the necessary requirements and follow the installation instructions provided in the next section. Once you have Jupyter Notebook set up, you can begin exploring the notebooks provided in this repository. Each notebook is designed to cover a specific topic and includes explanations, code examples, and exercises to help you practice what you learn.

## Requirements

To use the materials in this guild, you will need the following:

- Python (version 3.x)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Installation

1. Start by installing Python. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Once Python is installed, you can install Jupyter Notebook using the following command:

 ```
   pip install jupyter
 ```
 
Alternatively, you can use Anaconda or Miniconda distributions, which come with Jupyter Notebook pre-installed.

3. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Data-Analysis-Intro.git
```
Alternatively, you can download the repository as a ZIP file and extract it.

4. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd Data-Analysis-Intro
```

5. Launch Jupyter Notebook by running the following command:

```
jupyter notebook
```

This will open Jupyter Notebook in your web browser.

## Usage

Once you have Jupyter Notebook open, you can navigate to the notebooks in this repository and open them. Each notebook is self-contained and covers a specific topic related to data analysis. You can execute the code cells, modify them, and experiment with different approaches. The notebooks also provide explanations and exercises to help you deepen your understanding of the concepts.

Feel free to explore the notebooks in any order you prefer. If you are new to data analysis, we recommend starting with the "Introduction to Data Analysis" notebook, as it provides a solid foundation for the subsequent topics.
